# UVG-DragonFighters
## Goals
Create a program that allows interaction by turns between objects, in this context "Players".
## The Game
The game is based on this history:

**In the land of the rising sun, where shadows dance with destiny, a dark force awakens.**

*Introducing...*

### Kenki no Ō - The King of Swordsmanship

*"Strength is power, and he wields the blade with unrivaled might. Challenge him if you dare, but be prepared for a battle that will test your very existence."*

*But beware, as the story unfolds, a new adversary emerges.*

### Meikyū no Akuma - The Demon of the Labyrinth

*"In the heart of darkness, a labyrinth of despair awaits. Unravel the mysteries and face the embodiment of fear. Can you navigate the twists of fate, or will you succumb to the shadows that lurk within?"*

*And just when you thought you had conquered the darkness, witness the evolution.*

### Maho no Ōja - The Sorcerer King

*"Magic weaves through his veins, a sorcerer king who can mend his wounds with a mere incantation. The battle intensifies as he manipulates the very fabric of reality. Will you have the strength to face the convergence of sword and sorcery?"*

**Embark on a journey through the Sengoku period, where your fate intertwines with these formidable foes. The shadows grow deeper, and the labyrinth awaits. Will you rise to the challenge, or be consumed by the darkness?**

*Shadows of Destiny: Choose your path, for the dance of shadows has just begun.*

Coming soon to a gaming console near you... or whatever.
